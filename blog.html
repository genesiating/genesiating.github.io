    <h2>Chance the Rapper</h2>
    <h3>at the golden 1 center in sacramento (4/28/17)</h3>

    <p>On April 19th, 2017, I attended a Jai Wolf concert with one of my friends.  I had heard that Jai Wolf would be embarking on a festival tour, randomly making a few stops – one of which was at the Ace of Spades in Sacramento.  Surprisingly, tickets hadn’t been sold out in such an intimate venue yet so we decided to go.  The show was a sensory experience.  With Chet Porter as one of the openers, the crowd was becoming increasingly excited building up to Jai Wolf’s set.  As someone who knows very few Jai Wolf songs aside from “Indian Summer,” I enjoyed set very much.  The crowd wasn’t moshing too much so we had room to breathe, but the excitement level was definitely to the roof.  It was interesting observing how people sing along to EDM, as I hadn’t really been to any concert specifically for electronic music before (aside from festivals.)  Overall, it was a brilliant concert to experience.<br>

    <h2>Kehlani</h2>
    <h3>at the ace of spades in sacramento (4/26/17)</h3>

    <p>On April 26th, 2017, I revisited the Ace of Spades venue in Sacramento a week later, this time for Kehlani.  Kehlani is an R&B/Soul singer from Oakland, quite locally.  I went with three friends to Kehlani’s SweetSexySavage tour, but weren’t anywhere near the stage.  Fans had lined up hours earlier, while we had only arrived an hour and a half before doors opened.  The openers did a fantastic job of hyping the crowd up, and Sage the Gemini came out for a surprise performance.  Kehlani’s performance consisted of a vast 19-song setlist, most of them off of her recent debut album, with one song from “You Should Be Here,” and one from the even earlier “Cloud 19.”  Two couples were engaged at the show, and Kehlani dedicated “Hold Me By The Heart” to the two couples.  The mic audio was a bit low and difficult to hear from where we were standing, but otherwise it was a fantastic show with high energy.<br></p>

    <h2>Jai Wolf</h2>
    <h3>at the ace of spades in sacramento (4/19/17)</h3>

    <p>On April 28th, 2017, I went to the “Be Encouraged Tour” featuring Chance the Rapper at the brand new Golden 1 Center in Sacramento with my friend.  It was his first concert, so we had high expectations.  I had previously attended the “Magnificent Coloring Tour” in October 2016, so I was ready to re-experience Chance.  The DJ Oreo opener set was a little prolonged, but when Chance the Rapper came out, everyone was extremely hyped.  When Chance came out, I recognized that he mixed the order of his songs around a bit from his previous setlist.  He also did mashups of many of his songs, performing just one verse from a couple.  I personally prefer hearing the songs performed in full, but Chance made it work.  In a crowd of 20,000, this show was definitely different from his couple thousand fans at UC Davis last fall, the Davis show being a little bit more personable with the crowd.  It was still an incredible performance that I thoroughly enjoyed. <br>
